## Pairing
Connect your device to the Mycroft server

## Description 
The default backend to provide services for Mycroft users is
[Home](https://home.mycroft.ai/).  Pairing a device with Home provides access
to privacy-protecting Speech to Text, Wolfram Alpha and other such services,
as well as easy configuration for all your Mycroft devices.

## Examples 
* "Pair my device" (happens automatically on first run if not paired already)
